# Image to PDF Converter & OCR Search Tool

A Python GUI application that combines OCR-based document search with image-to-PDF conversion capabilities. Built to help universities digitise and manage pre-digital era scanned transcripts and degrees. Features an intuitive graphical interface with two operation modes: search through image files and PDFs using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to find specific documents, or bulk convert entire folders of images to searchable PDFs — all without needing to edit code.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Easy-to-use GUI built with tkinter - no code editing required
- **Dual Operation Modes**: Choose between Search Mode and Bulk Convert Mode via radio buttons
- **Folder Browser**: Browse and select input/output folders with native file dialogs
- **OCR Text Search**: Searches through images and PDFs using Tesseract OCR
- **Bulk Conversion**: Convert all images in a directory (and subdirectories) to searchable PDFs
- **Multiple Format Support**: Handles PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP, and TIFF files
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Falls back to partial keyword matching if exact match fails — returns the file(s) with the most keyword hits (all ties included)
- **Year Filtering**: Optional field to refine search results by year
- **Real-time Logging**: Processing status displayed in scrollable log window with progress counters
- **Smart Filename Generation**: Automatically names output PDFs using information extracted from the document (name, degree/admission date, document type)
- **Threaded Processing**: Non-blocking operations keep GUI responsive during long tasks
- **Pause & Stop Controls**: Pause processing between files and resume at any time, or stop early — a summary of completed work is always shown
- **Recursive Search**: Searches through entire directory structures
- **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages, success notifications, and conversion summaries

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

1. **Python 3.7+** — Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Tesseract OCR** — See installation instructions below
3. **Poppler** — Required by pdf2image for PDF rendering; see installation instructions below
4. **Python packages** — `ocrmypdf`, `pytesseract`, `pillow`, `pdf2image`

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/becktorrescoding/image_to_pdf
```
Or download and extract the ZIP from the GitHub page.

---

### 2. Install Tesseract OCR

#### Windows

1. Download the latest installer from the [Tesseract at UB Mannheim](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) page (recommended over the official releases for Windows)
2. Run the installer — note the installation path, which defaults to:
   ```
   C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\
   ```
3. **Add Tesseract to your PATH:**
   - Open the **Start Menu** and search for `Environment Variables`
   - Click **"Edit the system environment variables"**
   - In the System Properties window click **"Environment Variables..."**
   - Under **"System variables"**, find and select **`Path`**, then click **"Edit..."**
   - Click **"New"** and add the Tesseract installation path:
     ```
     C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\
     ```
   - Click **OK** on all windows to save
4. **Verify the installation** by opening a new Command Prompt and running:
   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   ```
   You should see the Tesseract version number printed.

> **Note**: If you see a `TesseractNotFoundError` when running the app, you can alternatively set the path directly in `image_to_pdf.py` by adding this line near the top of the file:
> ```python
> pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
> ```

---

#### macOS

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) if you don't have it already:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Tesseract:
   ```bash
   brew install tesseract
   ```
3. Homebrew automatically adds Tesseract to your PATH. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   ```
   You should see the Tesseract version number printed.

> **Note**: If the command is not found after installing, add Homebrew's bin directory to your PATH manually by adding this line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
> ```bash
> export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
> ```
> Then run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bash_profile`) and try again.

---

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. Update your package list and install Tesseract:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
   ```
2. Tesseract is automatically added to your PATH. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   ```
   You should see the Tesseract version number printed.

> **Note**: For other distributions use the equivalent package manager, e.g. `sudo dnf install tesseract` on Fedora or `sudo pacman -S tesseract` on Arch.

---

---

### 3. Install Poppler

Poppler is required by `pdf2image` to render PDF pages as images during search. It is **not** a Python package and must be installed separately.

#### Windows

1. Install Poppler via [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/):
   ```bash
   winget install oschwartz10612.poppler
   ```
2. **Verify** by opening a new Command Prompt and running:
   ```bash
   pdftoppm -v
   ```

#### macOS

```bash
brew install poppler
```

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

> **Note**: For other distributions use `sudo dnf install poppler-utils` (Fedora) or `sudo pacman -S poppler` (Arch).

---

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install ocrmypdf pytesseract pillow pdf2image
```

### 5. Launch the Application

```bash
python image_to_pdf.py
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
python image_to_pdf.py
```

A graphical window will open with the following interface:

---

### Step-by-Step Usage

#### 1. Select Folders
- **Input Folder**: Click "Browse" next to "Input Folder" and select the folder containing your images
- **Output Folder**: Click "Browse" next to "Output Folder" and select where you want PDFs saved

#### 2. Choose Operation Mode
Use the radio buttons to select your mode:
- **Search Mode**: Find specific documents by name (shows search fields)
- **Bulk Convert Mode**: Convert all images in the input folder (hides search fields)

#### 3. Search Mode — Enter Search Criteria
- **Search Name**: Type the student name to search for (e.g., "John Smith")
- **Year (Optional)**: Enter a graduation year (e.g., "98") to filter results. Leave blank to skip year filtering.

#### 4. Start Processing
Click the green **"Start Search"** button to begin. Once running, two additional buttons become available:
- **Pause** (orange) — suspends processing after the current file finishes. The button label changes to **Resume**; click again to continue.
- **Stop** (red) — signals the worker to stop after the current file. A summary dialog will appear showing how many files were processed.

#### 5. Monitor Progress
The Processing Log window shows real-time status.

**Search Mode example:**
```

```

#### 6. Results
- **Search Mode**: Success message box appears; PDF saved to output folder
- **Bulk Convert Mode**: Summary dialog shows total converted and any errors
- If no matches found (Search Mode), you'll see an informational message

---

### Search Behavior

**Exact Match First:**
The application searches for the exact name you entered in image text (via OCR).

**Automatic Fallback:**
If no exact match is found, it automatically tries partial matching:
- Splits your search into keywords (e.g., "John Smith" → ["John", "Smith"])
- Scores every file by how many keywords appear in the name region
- Returns only the file(s) with the **highest keyword count** — all ties are kept and shown in the preview
- Example: if two files each match 2 out of 3 keywords and no file matches all 3, both are returned

**Year Filtering:**
If you enter a year, matched files are filtered to only those containing that year in their text.

---

### Example Workflows

**Scenario 1**: Find and convert a transcript for "Jane Doe" who graduated in 1998

1. Launch app: `python image_to_pdf.py`
2. Browse input to: `C:/University/ScannedRecords`
3. Browse output to: `C:/University/Converted`
4. Select **Search Mode**
5. Enter name: `Jane Doe`
6. Enter year: `98`
7. Click "Start Search"
8. Find PDF at: `C:/University/Converted/scan_xyz.pdf`

**Scenario 2**: Bulk convert an entire archive of scanned degrees

1. Launch app: `python image_to_pdf.py`
2. Browse input to: `C:/University/DegreeArchive`
3. Browse output to: `C:/University/Converted`
4. Select **Bulk Convert Mode**
5. Click "Start Search"
6. Wait for completion summary

## How It Works

### GUI Architecture

The application uses a **class-based tkinter GUI** with the following structure:

```
ImageToPDFApp (Main Class)
├── __init__()              # Initialize window and variables
├── create_widgets()        # Build GUI interface
├── toggle_pause()          # Pause or resume processing
├── request_stop()          # Signal worker thread to stop after current file
├── _check_pause_stop()     # Called between files; blocks while paused, returns True if stopped
├── _reset_buttons()        # Re-enable Start and disable Pause/Stop
├── toggle_mode()           # Show/hide search fields based on mode
├── browse_input()          # Handle input folder selection
├── browse_output()         # Handle output folder selection
├── start_search()          # Validate inputs and start thread
├── do_search()             # Route to correct mode (runs in thread)
├── search_mode()           # Search Mode workflow
├── show_preview_window()   # Preview matched files before converting
├── bulk_convert_mode()     # Bulk Convert Mode workflow
├── open_as_image()         # Open image or PDF first page as PIL Image
├── search_folders()        # Exact text match via OCR (name region only)
├── search_fallback()       # Partial keyword matching (name region only, best-count wins)
├── search_images()         # Filter by year
├── generate_filename()     # Extract fields from OCR text and build filename
├── convert_image()         # Convert single image to searchable PDF
└── log()                   # Display messages in GUI
```

### Automatic Filename Generation (Search Mode)

When a document is converted in Search Mode, the output PDF is automatically named using information extracted from the OCR text rather than the original scanned filename.

**Degree format:**
```
LastName_FirstName_MI_DegreeName_Month_Day_Year.pdf
```
Example: `Smith_John_A_Bachelor_of_Commerce_June_12_1979.pdf`

**Transcript format:**
```
LastName_FirstName_MI_Transcript_Month_Day_Year.pdf
```
Example: `Smith_John_A_Transcript_March_3_1975.pdf`

**How it works:**
1. Detects document type by looking for `"Degree Received"` or `"Date of Admission"` in the OCR text
2. Extracts the student name — handles both `Last, First MI` and `First MI Last` formats
3. For degrees: extracts the degree name from the text following `"Degree Received"` and the graduation date to its right
4. For transcripts: extracts the admission date from the text following `"Date of Admission"`
5. Normalises dates to a consistent `Month_DD_YYYY` format regardless of how they appear in the document — both `June 12, 1979` and `06/12/79` will produce `June_12_1979`. 2-digit years are expanded automatically (`79` → `1979`, years `00–19` are assumed to be 2000s)
6. Assembles the parts into a clean filename, stripping invalid characters

**Fallback behaviour:**
If any field cannot be extracted, a warning is logged and the original scanned filename is used instead. This ensures conversion always completes even if the OCR output is unclear.

### Search Mode Workflow

1. **User Input**: User enters name and optional year via GUI fields
2. **Validation**: System checks all required fields are filled
3. **Threading**: Search runs in background thread (GUI stays responsive); Pause and Stop buttons become active
4. **OCR Processing**: The name region of each file is processed with Tesseract OCR (faster and more precise than full-page OCR)
5. **Text Matching**: Extracted name text is compared against search criteria
6. **Fallback**: If no exact match, automatically tries partial matching — returns the file(s) with the most keyword hits
7. **Filtering**: Optional year filter applied if provided
8. **Preview**: Matched files displayed as thumbnails in a preview window — user selects which to convert
9. **Conversion**: Selected file(s) converted to PDF with OCRmyPDF
10. **Notification**: User notified of success/failure

### Bulk Convert Mode Workflow

1. **Validation**: System checks input and output folders are provided
2. **File Discovery**: Recursively counts all valid image files in input folder
3. **Threading**: Conversion runs in background thread (GUI stays responsive); Pause and Stop buttons become active
4. **Batch Conversion**: Each image converted to searchable PDF with OCRmyPDF; pause/stop is checked between every file
5. **Progress Tracking**: Log shows per-file results and running count (X/total)
6. **Error Handling**: Individual file errors are logged; processing continues
7. **Early Stop**: If stopped by user, summary reports how many files completed before stopping
8. **Summary**: Completion dialog reports total converted and error count

### Technical Details

- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract (via pytesseract) extracts text from images
- **PDF Creation**: OCRmyPDF creates searchable PDFs with deskewing and forced OCR
- **Threading**: `threading.Thread` prevents GUI freezing during processing; `threading.Event` objects (`_pause_event`, `_stop_event`) coordinate pause and stop signals between the GUI and worker thread
- **File Handling**: `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform path management
- **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks catch and log errors gracefully

### Supported File Types

- PDF (`.pdf`)
- JPEG (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`)
- PNG (`.png`)
- BMP (`.bmp`)
- TIFF (`.tif`, `.tiff`, `.TIF`)

## Output

### Search Mode — Success
- **Preview Window**: All matched files shown as thumbnails with checkboxes; user selects which to convert
- **Searchable PDFs**: Selected document(s) saved to output folder with auto-generated structured filenames
- **Log Messages**: Real-time progress shown in GUI log window
- **Success Dialog**: Pop-up notification confirms how many files were converted

### Bulk Convert Mode — Success
- **Searchable PDFs**: All converted documents saved to output folder with auto-generated structured filenames (falls back to original filename if document type cannot be detected)
- **Progress Log**: Per-file status showing generated filename and running count (e.g., `✓ Success (12/42)`)
- **Summary Dialog**: Reports total files converted and number of errors

### No Matches Case (Search Mode)
- **Informational Dialog**: "No matching files found" message
- **Log Details**: Shows search attempts and why no matches were found

### Stopped by User
- **Log Message**: `⏹ Stopped by user.` appears in the log
- **Summary Dialog**: Reports how many files were converted before stopping
- **Start Button**: Re-enabled immediately so a new operation can begin

### Error Case
- **Error Dialog**: Specific error message displayed
- **Log Details**: Full error details in log window for debugging
- **Bulk Convert**: Errors are logged per file; remaining files continue processing

## Error Handling

The GUI includes comprehensive error handling:

### Input Validation
- **Empty Fields**: Error dialog if name or paths missing
- **Invalid Paths**: System validates folder existence before processing
- **Mode-aware**: Search Mode requires a name; Bulk Convert Mode does not

### Processing Errors
- **OCR Failures**: Logged with filename and error details
- **Image Read Errors**: Skips corrupted files, continues processing others
- **Conversion Errors**: Detailed error message logged per file

### User Experience
- **Non-blocking Errors**: GUI remains responsive even during errors
- **Error Logs**: All errors displayed in log window for review
- **Graceful Degradation**: Partial matches attempted if exact match fails (Search Mode)

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "Please select both input and output folders." | Missing folder paths | Browse and select both folders |
| "Please enter a name to search for." | Search Mode with empty name field | Enter a name to search |
| "Error processing [file]" | Corrupted or unreadable image | Check image file integrity |
| "No matching files found" | No documents contain search text | Verify spelling, try partial name |
| Tesseract error | OCR engine not installed | Install Tesseract OCR |

## Privacy & Data Security

All processing is performed **entirely locally on your machine**. No files, text, or metadata are transmitted over the internet at any point.

| Dependency | Data Collection | Network Access |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| Tesseract OCR | None | None — fully offline |
| OCRmyPDF | None | None — fully offline |
| Pillow | None | None — fully offline |
| pdf2image / Poppler | None | None — fully offline |
| tkinter | None | None — fully offline |

This makes the tool suitable for handling sensitive documents such as university transcripts and degrees, where student records should remain confidential and within your institution's systems.

> **Tip**: For added assurance, you can run the application on an air-gapped machine or monitor outbound network traffic with a tool like Wireshark to independently verify no data leaves your system.

## Limitations

- **OCR Accuracy**: Depends on image quality, text clarity, and scan resolution
- **Processing Speed**: Large directories or high-resolution images can be slow
- **Network Drives**: May be slower than local storage; consider copying files locally first
- **Search OCR Region**: Name search targets a fixed crop region `(337, 203, 727, 261)` — documents with a different layout may not match correctly
- **Filename generation accuracy**: Auto-naming relies on OCR quality — poor scans may fall back to the original filename
- **Year Format**: Searches for year as a text string in OCR output; works with both 2-digit and 4-digit years depending on what appears in the document
- **GUI Responsiveness**: During OCR processing, only log updates; Start button disabled until complete; Pause and Stop active during processing
- **Memory Usage**: Processing very large images may consume significant RAM
- **Bulk Output Folder**: All converted files written to a flat output folder (subdirectory structure not preserved)

## Troubleshooting

### GUI Won't Open
**Symptom**: Double-clicking does nothing or window appears then closes

**Solutions**:
- Run from terminal to see error messages: `python image_to_pdf.py`
- Check Python version (requires 3.7+)
- Verify tkinter is installed: `python -m tkinter` (should open test window)

### "Tesseract not found" Error
**Symptom**: `TesseractNotFoundError` when clicking "Start Search"

**Solutions**:
- Ensure Tesseract OCR is installed — see the [Installation](#installation) section for your OS
- Open a terminal and run `tesseract --version` to confirm it's on your PATH
- **Windows**: If it's still not found after adding to PATH, open a fresh Command Prompt (the old one won't pick up the change) and try again. Alternatively, set the path directly in `image_to_pdf.py`:
  ```python
  pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
  ```
- **macOS**: Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile` after updating PATH, then retry

### OCRmyPDF Errors
**Symptom**: PDF conversion fails

**Solutions**:
- Install Ghostscript (required by OCRmyPDF)
- Check output folder is writable
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Try with smaller/simpler image first

### No Matches Found (Search Mode)
**Symptom**: "No matching files found" message

**Solutions**:
- Verify image quality is clear enough for OCR
- Check spelling of search name
- Try searching for just first or last name
- Test with known document to verify OCR is working
- Images with handwriting may not work well

### GUI Freezes
**Symptom**: Window becomes unresponsive

**Solutions**:
- Wait - processing may take time for large folders
- Check log window for progress updates
- Force quit and try with smaller folder first
- Reduce image resolution if files are very large

### Browse Button Not Working
**Symptom**: Clicking Browse does nothing

**Solutions**:
- Check file system permissions
- Try running as administrator (Windows)
- Verify folder paths don't contain special characters

### Output PDF is Empty or Corrupted
**Symptom**: PDF created but contains no content

**Solutions**:
- Check original image contains readable text
- Verify image file isn't corrupted
- Try with different image format
- Increase image contrast before processing
